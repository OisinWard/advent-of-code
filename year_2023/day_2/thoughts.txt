Need to parse the string. The game can  be dropped but the game id is essential to keep.
Next There are 3 draws.
Only one draw needs to fail to fail the whole test for the game. 
As well only one colour needs to fail. 
So we could think of the 3 draws as one and find any place where a colour fails.
I can use regex to check for a sting like greater than 12 red cubes etc and so on for each colour.

get file input
  for each line in file
     check for "(1[3-9] red|1[4-9] green|1[5-9] blue|[2-9][0-9] red|[2-9][0-9] green|[2-9][0-9] blue)"
     if regex string matches then continue
     else add the game id to sum
